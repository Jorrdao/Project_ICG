## Overview

**Reel it in** is a 3D fishing mini-game built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Cannon-es](https://github.com/pmndrs/cannon-es). The player casts a bobber into the water, waits for a fish to bite, and plays a timing-based minigame to reel in different types of fish — or occasionally junk like an old boot.

Key features include:
- Interactive start/help menu
- Realistic bobber splash and vibration and shadow animations
- Timing-based minigame for catching fish
- Inventory system with item icons and quantities
- Popups and visual feedback for successful/failed catches
